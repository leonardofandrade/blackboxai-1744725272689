# Service Manager

## Project Overview
Service Manager is a Django-based web application designed to assist in managing various services efficiently. The project provides a command-line utility for administrative tasks and serves as a foundation for building a robust service management platform.

## Installation
To set up the Service Manager project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/service_manager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd service_manager
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Django** (and any other dependencies if found):
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

6. **Set up the database**:
   You may need to configure your database settings in `service_manager/settings.py` before running migrations.

7. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser. You can manage your services through the web interface that Django provides.

## Features
- Administrative command-line interface for service management.
- Django backend providing a scalable architecture.
- Easy configuration for database settings.
- Can be extended with additional functionalities per requirements.

## Dependencies
